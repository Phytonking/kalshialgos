# Kalshi AI Hedge Fund Framework

An open source framework for automated hedge fund operations focused on Kalshi event contracts, leveraging LLM reasoning, deep research capabilities, and statistical analysis for systematic trading.

## 🚀 Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive foundation for AI-powered hedge fund operations on Kalshi Event Contracts. It combines:

- **LLM-powered research** for deep market analysis
- **Statistical modeling** for probability estimation
- **Risk management** for portfolio protection
- **Automated execution** for systematic trading

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Data Pipeline Module (`data/`)
- **Collectors**: Kalshi API, news aggregation, social sentiment, economic indicators
- **Processors**: Event parsing, text processing, feature extraction
- **Storage**: Time series database, document store

### Research Intelligence Module (`research/`)
- **LLM Agent**: Reasoning engine, research planner, fact checker
- **Analyzers**: Event analysis, correlation finding, scenario generation
- **Knowledge Base**: Market memory, expert knowledge

### Statistical Analysis Module (`analysis/`)
- **Models**: Time series, ML models, deep learning, ensemble methods
- **Backtesting**: Strategy testing, risk metrics, simulations
- **Optimization**: Portfolio optimization, risk adjustment

### Trading Engine Module (`trading/`)
- **Strategy**: Signal generation, position management, risk management
- **Execution**: Order management, Kalshi trading logic, slippage modeling
- **Portfolio**: Tracking, rebalancing

### Risk Management Module (`risk/`)
- **Monitors**: Exposure, correlation, drawdown monitoring
- **Models**: VaR calculations, stress testing, liquidity assessment
- **Controls**: Position limits, circuit breakers

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kalshi-hedge-fund
cd kalshi-hedge-fund
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `config.py` file:

```python
KALSHI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/kalshi_db"
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4"
RISK_LIMITS = {
    'max_position_size': 0.05,  # 5% of portfolio
    'max_drawdown': 0.20,       # 20% maximum drawdown
    'var_limit': 0.02           # 2% daily VaR
}
```

## 📖 Basic Usage

```python
from kalshi_hedge_fund import KalshiHedgeFund

# Initialize the framework
hedge_fund = KalshiHedgeFund(config_path="config.py")

# Analyze a contract
contract = hedge_fund.get_contract("CONTRACT_ID")
analysis = hedge_fund.analyze_contract(contract)

# Generate trading signal
signal = hedge_fund.generate_signal(analysis)

# Execute trade (if signal is strong enough)
if signal.confidence > 0.7:
    hedge_fund.execute_trade(signal)
```

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11+**: Primary development language
- **PostgreSQL**: Time series and relational data
- **Redis**: Caching and real-time data
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **OpenAI API**: LLM reasoning and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Traditional ML models
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning

## 📊 Risk Considerations

- **Model Risk**: Overfitting, concept drift
- **Data Quality**: Incomplete or biased data
- **Execution Risk**: Slippage, failed orders
- **Market Risk**: Liquidity, correlation, event risk
